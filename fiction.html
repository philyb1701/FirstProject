			<h4><u>The Count of Monte Cristo</u></h4>

			<p>"I see you are a philosopher," said Villefort, after a momentary silence in which he had been gathering strength like a wrestler meeting a powerful opponent. "Well, Monsieur, I do declare, if, like you, I had nothing to do, I should look for a less melancholy pastime."</p>
		<p style="color: dimgray; font-family: arial; text-align: center; font-size: 14px;"
			<p>"Very true, Monsieur," said Monte Cristo. "Mankind is an ugly worm when you look at it through a solar microscope. But I think you said I have nothing to do. Now, Monsieur, I ask you, do you imagine you have anything to do? Or, to put it more clearly, do you believe that what you do deserves to be called something?"</p>

			<p>An absolute stunner of a novel - I couldn't put it down. I recommend making sure you read the unabridged version if you're starting it out. One of the most important and pertinent lessons I pulled from it is how one cannot experience true happiness without knowing life's deepest sorrow. It's a wonderful lesson in perspective and its help me face problems with a clearer and broader understanding ever since. </p>

			<p>A book I recently purchased after a recommendation from someone close to me, saving it for my holiday!</p>

			<h3><u>Ulyesses</u></h3>
		<p style="color: dimgray; font-family: arial; text-align: center; font-size: 14px;"
			<p>A classic, one everyone recommends that I should read at least once. Looking forward to it!</p>
